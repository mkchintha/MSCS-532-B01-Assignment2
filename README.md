# Divide-and-Conquer Sorting Algorithm Analysis

This project explores and compares two fundamental divide-and-conquer sorting algorithms — **Merge Sort** and **Quick Sort** — through both theoretical analysis and practical implementation using Python.

## Algorithms Implemented

### Merge Sort
- **Stable** sorting algorithm
- Consistent time complexity: `O(n log n)`
- Suitable for large datasets and external sorting

### Quick Sort (with Random Pivot)
- **In-place** and typically faster
- Average time complexity: `O(n log n)`
- Worst-case avoided using **randomized pivot selection**

## Performance Evaluation

Each algorithm is tested on:
- Sorted data
- Reverse sorted data
- Random data

The performance metrics recorded:
- Execution Time (ms)
- Memory Usage (KB)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/divide-conquer-analysis.git
    cd divide-conquer-analysis
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python divide_conquer_sorting.py
    ```

3. Output will include benchmark results for each sorting algorithm.
